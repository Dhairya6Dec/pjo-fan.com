            <p>I sighed as we walked into the museum with my classmates. I was the the last one to step in along with his friend Grover. I was glaring at Nancy Clatence making sure she doesn't try to shove water up my nose since she was right in front of us. I go to Yancy Academy, bording school for troubled children. Am I a troubled child. You can plaster a sticky note on my head saying "YES!". I have been kicked ot of at least (boarding schools) in my short life of years. As Mr. Brunner was going on and on about greek gods I hid my headphones on the other sie of my backpack strap and through my sleeve pretending Nancy Clatence had smacked in the ear (not that Mrs. Dodds my pre-alegebra teacher would care.)

                For lunch of course Nancy just has to tease Grover by casually throwing pieces of peant butter sandwiches at him. This time didn't care I ATTACKED NANCY. Spewing her capri-sun all over her and covering her face with peanut butter. She ran away like a scared little pig. She ofc snitched and Mrs. Dodds dragged me inside the museum. So suddenly she started transforming into something gruesome. She grew wings and horns and her mouth grew fangs, I instantly knew what she was turning into. Mr. Brunner suddenly appeared and tossed me a pen. <i>A pen? Are you stupid? what is pen going to do?</i>. I got very mad a pen at this time? He told me to click it I relunctantly did it grew into a sword and it incinerated Mrs. Dodds. <i>Congrats Percy you just vaporized your teacher!</i></p>

                    <h2> Chapter 2: Grover Unexpectedly loses his pants</h2>
                    <p>zI took the school bus back home I was overflowed with excitement but I was very mad and sad that I got expelled for "killing my teacher". I arrived and jumped and hugged mom her hair still smelled like the same lavender her skin still had the same glow and smelly Gabe (my stepdad) he shouted at my mom to make his 7 layer cheese dip I swear my hand lift up to punch him but my mom caught it. "Honey we need him he supports us financially you know how much we need him.". "Mom, what do u see in him." My mom stood there quietly and she walked to bedroom. We're going to Montauk. Instantly images of my dad's sillhouhette flshed through my mind. And I had mixed feelings about that place. "I've already packed the bags let me make Gabe's dip". If my mom didn't ;love him I would've yeeted thw whole thing in his fat, chubby face. All he did is sit on the couch and bark orders at me and my mom. We finally picked up Grover and left for montauk. Montauk is a beach near New York.

                         As we were diving a huge stom broke out. We saw stries of lightning everywhere imaginable. One hit the sea and a huge wave crashed into the bay. As we were driving cautiously a huge sillhouhette just appeared in front of us . It stopped the car. I looked at it very closely. It had horns bright yellow eyes and fangs like as snakes. This is any 6 yr old's nightmare. We got out and look at the monster he grinned in a evil manner and threw the car so far any sane person would've that he threw it into another dimension. We started running I don't know where but we just ran in the opposite direction. The "monster" easily caught up with us. This time I got angry. I ran straight for it. "PERCY!", Mom and Grover both yelled. I didn't care I charged. This might disgust but I pulled his horn of. I stood there, terrified of what I had just done but the rage in my eyes wasn't over. I ran back and I saw a fountain of blood spewing from his head he groaned loaudly. Suddenly a huge gust of wind blew so hard Grover over and his pants flew off. Revealing furry lugs. WHAT THE HELL GROVER" I screamed so many things were happening at once. "PERCY" mom yelled run everybody run now follow me! We followed mom not knowing where she was taking us. We reached a forest with the sign saying "camp half blood" we ran in. trying to take mom in but it was like a invisible barrier holding her back we kept pulling her. "MOM COME ON", "sorry percy", she said In a sad voice". The monster ran and charged at mom and she perished. " NO NO NO THIS CAN"T" so many things happening at once. I found out grover is some animal, my mom perished and I had pulled off a horn from the creature. I WENT black.
